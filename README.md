# RayTracer

Ray tracing is a powerful technique used to generate realistic digital images by simulating the inverse path of light. This project aims to develop a ray tracer program that can generate high-quality images based on a scene configuration file.

We had the following objectives:
* have multiple types of primitives (Spheres, Planes, Cylinders, ...)
* have multiple types of lights (Point, Directionnal, ...)
* have at least an output to a ppm file
* load the elements from a json configutation file, using [nlohmann-json3](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/) library

## Before continuing...

This project is an EPITECH Project. If you are an EPITECH student, move out the way!

Nothing to see here... I don't want to be involved to your -42.

If you're not, no worries! You're welcome here!

### Prerequisites

To use this project, you'll need a compiler that supports C++ 20.

This project can generate images in a [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org) window.

## Usage

### Building program

RayTracer is a B-OOP-400 EPITECH module project.
It is build with [CMake](https://cmake.org/).

You can use this program as it follows:
```bash
# Compile the project with flags required to close properly shared libraries, only available with g++

./compile.sh --gcc
```

Once the project is build, the `raytracer` executable is built at the root, and the plugins in the `plugins` directories:
```bash
.
├── plugins
│   ├── encoder
│   │   ├── ppmEncoder.so
│   │   └── sfmlEncoder.so
│   ├── lights
│   │   ├── ambient.so
│   │   ├── directional.so
│   │   └── point.so
│   │
│   ├── primitives
│   │   ├── cone.so
│   │   ├── cylinder.so
│   │   ├── plane.so
│   │   └── sphere.so
│   └── renderer

```
